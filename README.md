# websocket echo server

Simple websocket server that echoes your client messages.

Useful for test and other things I guess.

# development

You'll need [`Docker`](https://www.docker.com) installed in your machine.

Check the `Makefile` there you'll find all the useful commands to run the project. First run `make` to build and run the project.

# docker hub

WIP, not deployed yet to docker hub
